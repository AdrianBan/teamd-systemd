teamd-systemd
------------------------------------

This service adds bootup services for teamd daemon for creating teams
interfaces which can be controlled by ifup scripts.
In ifup scripts you can add only the necessary slave interfaces like:

auto po0
iface po0 inet manual
    mtu 9000
    pre-up    /usr/bin/teamdctl $IFACE port add gi2-0
    up        /sbin/ip link set $IFACE up
    post-down /sbin/ip link set $IFACE down

You need to add a configuration file in /etc/teamd/ for each interface
like this example:

/etc/teamd/po0.conf
{
    "device": "po0",
    "runner": {
       "name": "lacp",
       "active": true,
       "fast_rate": true,
       "tx_hash": ["vlan", "ipv4", "ipv6"] 
    },
    "link_watch": {
        "name": "ethtool"
    }
}

This service can be activated like this:

  systemctl enable teamd@po0
  systemctl start teamd@po0

Where po0 whill be the teamed interface.
Attention! teamdctl need the salve interface to be DOWN before will 
be added in the team. So in networking configuration file DO NOT 
PUT THE SLAVE in UP state!
